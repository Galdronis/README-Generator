## Project Description 

For our First Project together we wanted to make a Travel Guide to Columbus where live API's feed their data into our widgets and placements. Columbus is a great city and we want to show it off! My projects are on display via Github, with clickable images as well as my resume in a clickable PDF file.

## Installation

### Contributing

As a User I want to look up Columbus and view varied information about the city, Restuarents, Places to go, and History of the city. I want to see the current weather information and a clean page with smoot transitions to other pages and mobile friendly scaling.

**Project Requirements:**

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
